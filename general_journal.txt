    getting back into the anomaly stuff
    need to omit all vertical lines (and exterior lines)
    then account for unbalanced lines by anomaly line

    okay think it's all done correctly now... wasn't too too bad
    next steps are organizing all the mess and uploading the data somewhere

    trying to implement kate's proportion thing for the quadrant analysis
    it's just such a weird way of thinking about it
    think about a single trial
        there are six lines on the x axis, three in every other quadrant
        so if i select all three on x axis, that's a proportion of 0.5 max
        whereas max proportion for all other quadrants is 1
        that asymmetry feels important...
        i get that adjusting for number of lines in the quadrant is important.. but i just dont know

    all analyses done thus far are summarized at https://davebraun.net/opam

    need to get things together for the poster
    focus on getting a real rigorous characterization of those biases that we know are there
        think back through why i did counts and not proportions

    how to handle statistics with hits / misses / false alarms
        misses are over inflated bc there's many correct lines they could have not chosen on any trial

	alright can i organize this mess at all?
	what would a publishable finding from these data even look like?
		think: problem -> cause -> solution
	problems are the biases that have been outlined
		i could still look at the extent to which these search biases impact performance
		could correlate IDs in search biases with IDs in accuracy
	also correlate IDs in response time (& clustering groups) with choice biases

	i think these correlations are worth doing and might be informative.. but we have such weak causal leverage in this paradigm
		addressing the 'cause' part of my chain above is going to be tentative at best

	trying to get a handle on the thickness of lines and what distribution spread would be appropriate
	the perceived difference in thickness between 1 px vs. >= 1.15 px is obvious
		that same perception between anything even 0.5 px apart is really challenging when they're presented right next to each other

		suggests the function between perceived and actual thickness is not linear

	we discovered that width is perceived different depending on angle of line rotation
		unclear whether the difference is perceptual, mechanical or both
