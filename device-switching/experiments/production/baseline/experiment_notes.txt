new experiment

	make it like arrington, 2008
		get stimuli from here
	two stimuli
	dedicate task to display (counterbalanced)
	include forced choice trials (only one stimulus appears)
		10% each task
		not constrained to only switch
	even / odd, consonant / vowel
	start with no soa
		but program in an soa so we can change it
		500 rsi
	no accuracy feedback

	equally often instructions, not random
		both tasks are important, try to balance
		it's like microscopy

	calculate transition in exp
